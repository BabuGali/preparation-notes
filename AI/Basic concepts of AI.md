AI has become increasingly important in modern society for a variety of reasons:
		- Efficiency
		- Improved decision making
**Machine Learning**
 - It is a subset of AI
 - It trains the algorithms to make decisions or predictions based on input data
 - Unlike traditional programming, where rules and logic are explicitly defined, ML algorithms are trained using large datasets to learn patterns and make decisions.
