- Simple Storage Service
- - With S3TA(**S3 Transfer accelerator**) - you pay only that are accelerated
- **S3TA** improves the transfer performance **by routing traffic** through **Amazon CloudFronts globally distributed Edge Locations**
- Object Lock works only in versioned buckets. Enabling Object Lock automatically enables Bucket Versioning
##### Region
- You cannot change the region associated with an s3 bucket. You have to **delete the old bucket and then re-create it in the new region**
##### give permission to other accounts
- It's also a best practice to use IAM policies and bucket policies (instead of ACLs) to manage cross-account access to buckets and objects
##### Cost
-There are **no S3 data transfer charges** when data is transferred in **from the internet**
- Requester Pays options - Requester pays the data transfer charges
- keywords
	1. bucket
	2. bucket policy
	3. Amazon Athena
- It does not support SMB protocol 
##### How does authorization work with multiple access control mechanisms?
- In accordance with the principle of **least privilege**, decisions default to DENY and an explicit DENY always trumps an ALLOW. For example, if an IAM policy grants access to an object, the S3 bucket policies deny access to that object, and there is no S3 ACL, then access will be denied. Similarly, if no method specifies an ALLOW, then the request will be denied by default. Only if no method specifies a DENY and one or more methods specify an ALLOW will the request be allowed.
##### ACL Vs Bucket Policy
- ACL is for buckets and **also objects**
- IAM or Bucket policies attached to buckets, but **not objects**
- In the case of an existing bucket that already has objects in it, after you disable ACLs, the object and bucket ACLs are no longer part of an access evaluation, and access is granted or denied on the basis of policies.
##### Bucket Policy vs IAM
- Bucket policy directly attached to S3 directly rather than to an IAM user
- Wen to use Bucket Policy Vs IAM Policy
	- Use S3 bucket policies if:
		- If you’re more interested in “**Who can access this S3 bucket?**”, then S3 bucket policies will likely suit you better.
		- You want a simple way to grant to your S3 environment, without using.
		- Your IAM policies bump up against the size limit (up to 2 KB for users, 5 KB for groups, and 10 KB for roles). S3 supports bucket policies of up to 20 KB.
		- You prefer to keep access control policies in the S3 environment.
	 - Use IAM Policies if:
		 - If you’re more interested in “**What can this user do in AWS?**”, then IAM policies are probably the way to go
		 - You need to control access to AWS services other than S3.
-  **Amazon Athena - directly query the data in S3** 
- Three types of server side encryption
	1. server side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys ( SSE- S3)
	2. server side encryption with KMS keys stored in AWS key management service ( SSE - KMS)
	3. server side encryption with customer provided encryption keys (SSE-C)
##### IAM Access Analyzer for S3 to review bucket access
- You can use IAM Access Analyzer for S3 to review buckets with bucket ACLs, bucket policies, or access point policies that grant public access.
-  IAM Access Analyzer for S3 alerts you to buckets that are configured to allow access to anyone on the internet or other AWS accounts, including AWS accounts outside of your organization
##### To improve read performance
  - use parallelized reading via byte-range fetches
	  - Using the Range HTTP header in a GET Object request, you can fetch a byte-range ( 8MB or 16 MB) from an object with concurrent connections, instated of whole-object request
- Use CloudFront to cache the static files
- Partitioned prefix for distributing key names as part of naming patterns 
-  Enable transfer acceleration feature on S3
  - Extract metadata with Lambda
	  - using Lambda triggers populate DynamoDB tables with object names and metadata. Then OpenSearch service is used to search specific assets
	   ![[S3-Extract metadata.png]]
##### To improve write performance
- Multipart upload
##### S3 Glacier
- S3 Glacier Retrieval Policy
	1. No Retrieval limit - **default retrieval policy** -  used when you do not want to set any retrieval quota
	2. Free Tier - **no additional charges** with in the daily limit - rejects remaining all retrieval request after reaching daily limit
	3.  Max Retrieval Rate - when you want more data that what  is in your Free Tier
	4. Standard Retrieval -  which takes around 12 hours to retrieve data
-  **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval Storage Class vs S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class**
	- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is an archive storage class that delivers the lowest-cost storage for long-lived data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in milliseconds
	- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval provides three retrieval options
		- Expedited - Expedited retrieval type is not available for objects stored in the **Glacier Deep Archive** storage class
		- Standard
		- Bulk
- Archive retrieval options - to retrieve archived object from S3
	- Expedited - Quickly access your data stored in s3 glacier, 1-3 minutes
	- Standard  - with in several hours , 3 to 5 hours
	- Bulk - the low cost retrieval option, 5 to 12 hours
		![[S3 retrieval options.png]]
	1. Expedited -
		1. for quick access 
		2. available with in 1-5 minutes
		3. **Provisioned capacity** helps to retrieve when you need it, 
	2. Standard - default option-  access with in server hours
		1. standard retrieval are free for objects of S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	3. Bulk 
		1. low cost retrieval option
		2.  finish with in 5-12 hours
		3. free for S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Intelligent-Tiering objects
- S3 cross region replication
	- asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets
	- minimize latency
	- No additional charges for cross regional replication
- Same region replication
	- Same-Region Replication (SRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in the same AWS Region.
	- Aggregate logs into a single bucket
	- **Configure live replication between production and test accounts**
- Tags
	- To track storage costs and organize buckets
##### Controlling Access to S3 Buckets and Objects
- User Policies
	- Use the AWS IAM policy syntax to grant access to IAM users
	- attached to particular user 
- Bucket Policies
		-   Use the AWS IAM policy syntax to manage access for a particular S3 bucket
		- attached to resource
- Access Control Lists
	- Uses XML grant access to specific S3 bucket or objects
	- attached to resources
- 
- A **legal hold** provides the same protection as a **retention period**, but it has no expiration date. Instead, a legal hold remains in place until you explicitly remove it.
##### Retention Periods
- different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods
- specifies a **fixed period of time during** which an object remains locked
- can place retention period on object either explicitly or through a bucket default setting
- with **default bucket settings**, you **don't specify a Retain Until Date**. Instead you specify a duration**, days or years**
- object is WORM-protected and the object version cannot be deleted or changed
- **Different version**s of single object can have **different retention modes** and periods
- When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a **Retain Until Date** for that object version
- two retention period modes
	- **governance mode** -  you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you can still grant some user permission to alter retention settings or delete objects if necessary.
	- **compliance mode** -  a protected object version cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account.
##### lifecycle transitions
- objects **smaller than 128kb** 
	- does not transitions objects that are smaller than 128 kb, bcz it is not cost effective
- **Minimum days** for transition
	- 30 days
- minimum 30-day storage charge for s3 intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 one z-ne-IA
- S3 lifecycle valid transitions
	- ![[S3-Lifecycle transitions.png]]
- S3 One Zone-IA
	- it is for data that is accessed less frequently, but required rapid access when needed
	- to reduce cost 20% less than the s3 Standard-IA
	- minimum storage duration is 30 days before you can transition objects from S3 standard to S3 One Zone-IA
	- use cases
		- a lower cost option for infrequently accessed and re-creatable data
		- does not require the availability and resilience of S3 standard or S3 standard-IA
- S3 Ingress Connector
	- S3 Ingress Connector can be used **to pull S3 objects from Amazon AWS S3 buckets**.
- Blocking Public access
	- public access is granted to buckets and objects through ACLs, access point policies, bucket policies or all
	- S3 doesn't support block public access setting on a per-object basis
##### S3 Glacier Vault lock
- helps you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy. 
- You can specify controls such as **"write once read many"** (WORM) in a Vault Lock policy and **lock the policy from future edits.**
- **Vault Lock policy Vs Vault access policy**
- After a Vault **Lock policy is locked,** the policy can **no longer be changed or deleted.**
##### Amazon S3 Bucket Keys
- Amazon S3 Bucket Keys reduce the cost of Amazon S3 server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).

##### Server Side Encryption
- S3 bucket key for client side encryption
- SSE-S3
	- each object is encrypted with unique key
- SSE- with customer master kyes (CMK's) sotred in SSE-KMS
	- its is same as SSE-S3, but with aditional benefits and charges for using this service
	- use Customer managed CMK's or AWS managed CMK's
	- Provides audit trail to know when used and by whom
- SSE-C
	-encryption with customer provided Keys. 
	![[S3 Endpoints.png]]
##### Exam Questions
- can store 0 KB to 5 TB
- Application slow to access files , videos
	- use CloudFront to cache the static files
	- enable transfer acceleration feature on S3
- EC2 instance accessing S3,over internet, security risk for data
	- Access data through S3 endpoint for amazon S3 
 - Amazon Macie use to discover ad protect sensitivity data that is stored in S3
 ##### Resource Based Policies and Identity-based policies
 - **Identity-based policies** are attached to an IAM user, group, or role.
 - **Resource-based policies** are attached to a resource.
