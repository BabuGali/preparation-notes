- Solid State Drives and Hard Disk Drives
- SSDs store data in flash memory, while HDDs store data in magnetic disks
- HDD are less cost than SSD
- SSD are more durable
- SSDs run faster and use less energy than HDDs.
##### When to use SSD vs. HDD
- You should use a solid state drive (SSD) when you need high speeds or deal with frequent read/writes on large data volume. SSDs are a better choice for data analytics or gaming workloads.
- On the other hand, a hard disk drive (HDD) is a better choice if you are dealing with data backups, data archives, or throughput-intensive workloads. SSDs are more cost-effective for storing high-volume data with infrequent access.
