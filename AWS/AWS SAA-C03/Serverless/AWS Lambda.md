-  supports 1000 concurrent executions per AWS account per region
- Amazon SNA message delivers will be throttled if the concurrency quotas limit exceed
- When requests come in faster than you Lambda function can scale, then additional requests fails as the  Lambda throttles these requests with error code 429 status code 
- AWS Lambda charged based on
	- memory allocated to lambda function
	- the total no of request to LF
-  Lambda integrates with services like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray
- If lambda terminates after 15 minutes
	- NONE, SQS, SNS
	 - you can configure NONE, SQS, SNS, then to sends the payload for asynchronous invocation
	 -  invocation errors
	 - function errors
- Lambda layers - used to package code 
- Lambda aliases - used to refer specific version
- Customise the Lambda functions that performs the rotation of the keys in the AWS secret manager
- return error code 429 - for too many requests; when exceeded limit
##### Use Cases
- Operating serverless websites
- Massively scaling operations
- Real-time processing of high volumes of data
- Predictive page rendering
- Scheduled events for every task and data backup
- Parse user input and cleanup backend data to increase a website’s rapid response time
- Analyzing log data on-demand
- Integrating with external services
- Converting documents into the user-requested format on-demand
#### Fargate vs Lambda
- Purpose : 
	- Fargate - Manage container-based serverless apps without needing to provision servers and clusters
	- Lambda - Serverless computing option to manage small portions of an app, for example, a function
- Execution Time
	-  Fargate - Unlimited
	-  Lambda - max 15 min
- Network
	- Fargate - private subnet ( public is not best practice)
	- Lambda - private and public
