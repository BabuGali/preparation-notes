SOLID
- The Single Responsibility Principle
- The Open Closed Principle
- The Liskov Substitution Principle
- The Interface Segregation Principle
- The Dependency Inversion Principle

- This Principle helps software developer to design robust, testable, extensible and maintainable software systems
- Each of these FIVE design principles solvers particular problem that arises while developing software systems. 
 - **Single Responsibility Principle**
	- It states that a class, Module, function should have only one reason to change, means it should do one thing
- **Open Closed Principle**
	- It states that a class, Module or function should be open for extension but close for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**
	- It states that the child classes or subclasses must be substitutable for their parent class
	- The child class must be able to replace the parent class
	- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base parents
- **Interface Segregation Principle**
	- It states that client should not be forced to implement interface or methods which they do not use
	- More specifically, it suggest that software developers should break the** large interface into smaller**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**
	- It states that high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstraction. Abstraction should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction
	- 
- **Difference between Inversion and Dependency Injection**
	- The Dependency Inversion Principle focuses on making high-level and low-level modules depend on abstractions, while Dependency Injection is a technique for providing these abstractions to the modules at runtime
	- Dependency Inversion focuses on **architectural design principles**, emphasizing abstraction over concretion. **Dependency Injection is a practical technique that enables the implementation of Dependency Inversion by injecting dependencies externally**
