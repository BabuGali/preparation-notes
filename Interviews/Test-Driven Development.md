- The main intention of this technique is to modify or write a fresh code only when the test fails.
- Test-Driven Development is a testing methodology or a programming practice implemented from a developer’s perspective.
- The TDD methodology involves the following steps:
	- A developer writes an automated test case based on the requirements specified in the documents.
	- These tests are executed, and in some cases, they fail as they are developed before the development of an actual feature.
	- The development team then re-factors the code for the test to pass successfully.
	- TDD can be done by a single developer while writing both tests and application code side by side to complete a feature
