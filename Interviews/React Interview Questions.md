1. What is React?
2. What are the important features of React?
	1. It supports server side rendering
	2. It will make use of virtual DOM instead of Real DOM(Data Model Object)
	3. It supports unidirectional data binding
	4. It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view
	5. Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from
3. What are the limitations of React?
	1. React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.
	2. It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.
	3. Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.
4. What are react Components?
	1. Components are independent and reusable bits of code
	2. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.
	3. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components
5. What is Function Component?
	1. A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand
6. What is Class Component?
	1. A class component must include the `extends React.Component` statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React
7. What is Props
	1. Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.
8. Life Cycle of Components
	1. The three phases are: **Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting**.

10. What is useState() ?
	1. useState is **React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component**.
	2.  It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called
