- Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost
- Â it is most effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high
- Object pools (otherwise known as resource pools) are used to manage the object caching. A client with access to a Object pool can avoid creating a new Objects by simply asking the pool for one that has already been instantiated instead

- The object pool pattern keeps track of the objects it creates.
- Object Pools are usually implemented as Singletons
