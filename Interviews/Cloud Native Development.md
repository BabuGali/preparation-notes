# Cloud Native app
- A cloud-native application is a program that is designed for a cloud computing architecture.
- Cloud-native applications use a microservice architecture
- Cloud-native apps take advantage of cloud computing frameworks  and their loosely coupled cloud service. Because not all services are on the same server, cloud-native application developers must create a network between machines using software-based architectures. The services reside on different servers and they run in different locations. This architecture enables applications to scale out horizontally.
# Cloud-native vs. cloud-based apps
- Cloud-based applications may use dynamic cloud infrastructure but do not take full advantage of the inherent characteristics of the cloud.These are designed to use the cloud and cloud platforms
- Cloud-native application development is optimized for the inherent characteristics of the cloud and is adaptable to the cloud's dynamic environment.These are designed specifically for the cloud.
### Best practices for cloud-native application development
- Automate
- Monitor
- Document
- Make incremental changes
- Design for failure
